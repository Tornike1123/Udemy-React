Side Effect

> A React side-effect occurs when we use something that is **outside the scope of React.js** in our React components e.g. the Browser APIs like localStorage.
> It means that it is not part of the React framework, for example, the localStorage in your browser.
> When we use React with any of the Browserâ€™s API such as the localStorage, we are creating side-effects.
